"""Default-on anonymous aggregate telemetry beacon.

**Default: ON.** A first-run disclosure banner prints whenever telemetry
is enabled and the user has not yet acknowledged. Opt out:
``freeride telemetry off``.

What gets sent (only when enabled, hourly):

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "installation_id": "uuid-v4",
      "version": "0.3.0.dev0",

      "providers_active": ["openrouter", "nvidia_nim"],
      "uptime_hours": 8
    }

What NEVER gets sent: prompts, completions, model IDs, API keys,
hostnames, IP (the HTTPS request reveals an IP at the network layer;
the FreeRide endpoint discards it server-side).

This module owns the data plumbing. The beacon scheduler that POSTs
on a 1h tick lives in :mod:`freeride.server.telemetry_loop` (added
when the gateway needs it).

the design plan is the canonical spec.
